# About the Research Paper Competition

The **KAFTA Research Paper Competition** is a premier initiative dedicated to fostering innovation and professional excellence among the next generation of food scientists. [cite_start]By recognizing the outstanding research of Korean and Korean-American graduate students and post-doctoral associates, we aim to bridge the gap between academic discovery and industrial application[cite: 6].

### **Purpose and Vision**
[cite_start]The primary objective of this competition is to empower young professionals in the United States and Korea to develop transformative food technologies[cite: 6]. [cite_start]We provide a prestigious platform for emerging scholars to showcase research that demonstrates exceptional technical quality, originality, and the potential to advance the global food industry.

### **Award Pillars**
Our competition honors excellence across two distinct categories:
* [cite_start]**The Joh Foundation Research Award (Category 1):** Focuses on advancements in food chemistry and processing, particularly those related to functional ingredients for the food industry[cite: 6].
* [cite_start]**The Swagger Foods Award (Category 2):** Recognizes impactful contributions across the broader spectrum of food science and technology[cite: 6].

### **Commitment to Excellence**
[cite_start]To ensure the highest scholarly standards, all submissions undergo a rigorous **blind review process** conducted by a committee of six distinguished experts from both the United States and Korea. [cite_start]Submissions are evaluated on technical merit, clarity of presentation, and their overall contribution to the field[cite: 25]. [cite_start]Furthermore, all awardees commit to the long-term dissemination of knowledge by publishing their recognized research in **SCI or SCIE journals**[cite: 6].
