    <h1>About the Research Paper Competition</h1>
    <p>
        The KAFTA Research Paper Competition is a premier initiative dedicated to fostering innovation and professional excellence among the next generation of food scientists[cite: 2]. 
        By recognizing the outstanding research of Korean and Korean-American graduate students and post-doctoral associates, we aim to bridge the gap between academic discovery and industrial application[cite: 6].
    </p>

    <h3>Purpose and Vision</h3>
    <p>
        The primary objective of this competition is to encourage Korean-American and Korean young professional food scientists to develop new and transformative food technologies[cite: 6]. 
        We provide a prestigious platform for emerging scholars in the United States and Korea to showcase research that demonstrates exceptional technical quality and the potential to advance the global food industry[cite: 6].
    </p>

    <h3>Award Pillars</h3>
    <p>Our competition honors excellence across two distinct categories[cite: 6]:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>The Joh Foundation Research Award (Category 1):</strong> Focuses on advancements in food chemistry and food processing, particularly research related to food ingredients that can be applied to the food industry[cite: 6].
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The Swagger Foods Award (Category 2):</strong> Recognizes impactful contributions across the broader spectrum of food science not covered under Category 1[cite: 6].
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Commitment to Excellence</h3>
    <p>
        To ensure the highest scholarly standards, the Review Committee evaluates all submissions through a rigorous blind review process[cite: 24, 25]. 
        The committee consists of six experts, with three reviewers working in the field of food science in the USA and three in Korea[cite: 6]. 
        Submissions are evaluated based on technical quality, originality, clarity of presentation, and their overall contribution to the field[cite: 25]. 
        Furthermore, all awardees commit to the long-term dissemination of knowledge by publishing their recognized research in an SCI or SCIE journal within two years[cite: 6].
