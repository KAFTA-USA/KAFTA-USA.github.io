        <p>
            The KAFTA Research Paper Competition is a premier initiative dedicated to fostering innovation and professional excellence among the next generation of food scientists. 
            By recognizing the outstanding research of Korean and Korean-American graduate students and post-doctoral associates, we aim to bridge the gap between academic discovery and industrial application.
        </p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-top: 25px; color: #2c3e50;">Purpose and Vision</h3>
        <p>
            The primary objective of this competition is to encourage Korean-American and Korean young professional food scientists to develop new and transformative food technologies. 
            We provide a prestigious platform for emerging scholars in the United States and Korea to showcase research that demonstrates exceptional technical quality and the potential to advance the global food industry.

            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                <strong>Category 1 (Joh Foundation Research Award):</strong> This category focuses on food chemistry and food processing related to food ingredients that can be applied to the food industry.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Category 2 (Swagger Foods Award):</strong> This award recognizes excellence in general food science research not related to the specific criteria of Category 1.

        <h3 style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-top: 25px; color: #2c3e50;">Commitment to Excellence</h3>
        <p>
            To ensure the highest scholarly standards, the Review Committee evaluates all submissions through a rigorous blind review process. 
            The committee is comprised of six distinguished food scientists, with three reviewers based in the USA and three in Korea. 
            Submissions are assessed based on technical quality, originality, clarity of presentation, and the overall contribution to the field.
        </p>
        <p>
            In alignment with our commitment to academic dissemination, all awardees are required to attend the KAFTA in-person meeting to receive their award and are expected to publish their recognized research in an SCI or SCIE journal within two years.
        </p>
